### README for Designer: Use Case Tools

#### Overview
Designer: Use Case Tools is a web application designed to simplify the creation of software documentation. It allows users to generate various UML diagrams and specifications automatically, helping developers, analysts, and project managers document system requirements efficiently. 

#### Features
1. *Use Case Diagram*  
   - Input actor, features, and interactions to generate a visual Use Case Diagram.  
   - Ensures efficient system planning and documentation.

2. *Use Case Specification*  
   - Fill out a detailed specification template including actors, descriptions, scenarios, and conditions.  
   - Serves as a guideline for implementing functional requirements.

3. *Class Diagram*  
   - Create diagrams by entering class names, attributes, and operations.  
   - Supports defining relationships between classes.

4. *Activity Diagram*  
   - Automatically generate Activity Diagrams based on Use Case Specifications.  
   - Visualize system processes for clearer business understanding.

5. *Sequence Diagram*  
   - Enter boundary, controller, and entity details to create Sequence Diagrams.  
   - Illustrates object interactions and system execution flows.

#### Target Users
- *Software Developers*: For rapid UML diagram creation and accurate project documentation.  
- *System Analysts*: To streamline system analysis and requirement documentation.  
- *Project Managers*: For ensuring timely and structured documentation.  
- *General Users*: Intuitive interface designed for both technical and non-technical users.

#### Technology Stack
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- *Backend*: Django Framework (Python)  
- *Database*: MySQL  
- *Architecture*: MVC (Model-View-Controller)  
- *External API*: PlantUML for diagram generation  

#### System Requirements
- *Operating System*: Any OS with a web browser.  
- *Hardware*: Laptop or PC with internet access.  
- *Browser*: Modern browser with JavaScript enabled.

#### How to Use
1. *Input Data*: Navigate to the desired diagram or specification feature and fill in the required fields.  
2. *Generate Output*: Click "Generate" to produce the desired diagram or specification.
